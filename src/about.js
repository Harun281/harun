    My name is Harun Muriiki, born in the late 90s as third born in our family. 
    My childhood had its measure of challenges and good memories to remember. 
    As a kid, I always wanted to be a pilot. 
    The idea of boarding leave alone flying planes fascinated me. I guess it still does ðŸ˜Š.
    `,
    `
    My passion is coming up with tangible solutions to solve problems in society. 
    Technology itself is a powerful tool that can be used to solve both current and future problems. 
    Therefore, I use my knowledge as a web developer to put forward reliable, efficient 
    and affordable web applications that meet customer and community requirements.
    `,
    `
    Aside from web development, I love acquiring new knowledge and being up-to-date with current global trends. 
    When not coding, am either reading a book, going through blogs, or perusing my Twitter feed (Twitter is bae ðŸ˜Š). 
    Blogging too can't be excluded when it comes to Harun; I believe learning is two-way traffic (by receiving and giving).

    Well, Iâ€™m also in BTC trading and part-time freelancing jobs. 
    I've faith in Bitcoin's future as a leading cryptocurrency and working remotely as the ultimate job space.
